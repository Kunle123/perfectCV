# PerfectCV Development Memory Log

## Actions Taken

### 2024-04-04

1. Attempted to install Python dependencies

   - Outcome: Dependencies were already installed
   - Location: backend/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages
   - Status: ✅ Completed

2. Attempted to start backend server

   - Command: `cd backend && ./start_server.sh`
   - Outcome: Interrupted during execution
   - Status: ❌ Incomplete

3. Checked for existing processes on port 8000

   - Command: `lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null`
   - Outcome: No existing processes found
   - Status: ✅ Completed

4. Analyzed project structure

   - Verified backend directory structure
   - Checked start_server.sh script
   - Confirmed virtual environment setup
   - Status: ✅ Completed

5. Verified main.py configuration

   - FastAPI app is properly configured
   - CORS middleware is set up
   - API router is included
   - Root endpoint is defined
   - Status: ✅ Completed

6. Attempted direct server startup

   - Command: `python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
   - Outcome: Server started but encountered an error in the reloader process
   - Error: Traceback in multiprocessing/process.py
   - Status: ❌ Failed

7. Attempted server startup without reload

   - Command: `python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000`
   - Outcome: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.api.api_v1'
   - Status: ❌ Failed

8. Analyzed API module structure
   - Found api/v1 directory exists
   - Found api.py in v1 directory
   - Need to verify PYTHONPATH configuration
   - Status: ✅ Completed

## Current State

- Backend server is not running
- Frontend development server status: Unknown
- Database status: Unknown
- Test environment status: Unknown
- Project structure is properly set up
- Virtual environment exists and dependencies are installed
- FastAPI application is properly configured
- Server startup is failing with a module import error

## Known Issues

1. Backend server startup issues
   - Module import error for app.api.api_v1
   - Need to verify PYTHONPATH configuration
   - Need to check if the module is properly installed
2. Potential port conflicts
3. Need to verify frontend-backend connectivity

## Next Steps

1. Verify PYTHONPATH configuration
2. Check if the module is properly installed in the virtual environment
3. Try running the server with the correct PYTHONPATH
4. Check for any missing **init**.py files in the API module structure
